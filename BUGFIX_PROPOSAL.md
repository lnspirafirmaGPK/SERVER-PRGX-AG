# Bug Fix Proposal

## Scope
Major structural fix: migrate repository from static-only docs layout into complete Python backend architecture for PRGX-AG Nexus while preserving governance documentation intent.

## Findings
1. Backend architecture existed only as narrative, not executable modules.
2. No strict schemas, no event bus runtime, no orchestrator, and no policy tests.
3. Missing CLI, RSI loop, and triad-agent integration.

## Proposed fixes
1. Add `src/prgx_ag` modular backend with strict Pydantic models and async AetherBus.
2. Implement PRGX1/PRGX2/PRGX3 agents with Patimokkha-enforced healing flow.
3. Add orchestrator + RSI engine + bounded learning state.
4. Add pytest coverage for policy, bus, agents, RSI, and full cycle.

## Expected impact
- Architecture is now executable and testable.
- Harmful intents are programmatically blocked before write operations.
- Repository now supports production-style governance flow and self-healing cycle.

## Rollback
Revert this change set if consumers require previous static-only documentation repository state.

## 2026-03-17 Major structural fix
- Implemented full hybrid PRGX-AG architecture (.prgx-ag governance + GitHub workflows + Python runtime triad).
- Added strict schemas, event-driven nexus wiring, safe fix executor guardrails, RSI bounded learning, and manifest/policy loaders.
- Added deterministic pytest coverage for policy, bus, triad behavior, manifest loading, translation matrix, and full cycle flow.
